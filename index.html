		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		  OK, admit it -- you are a Java developer who hates JavaScript. How can a language that looks so similar to Java behave so differently? How come when I copy and paste it from the Internet, it no longer works? 
		</p>

		<p>
	JavaScript is not a perfect language -- no language written in 10 days by one person could be. But it is a lot better than you think it is. In this talk, I invite you to leave your biases at the door and learn -- maybe for the first time -- the good parts of JavaScript. There is real power in JavaScript once you understand it. Oh, and it couldn't be more different than Java...
